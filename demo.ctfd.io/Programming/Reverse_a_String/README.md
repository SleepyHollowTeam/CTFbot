Write code in Python that will reverse the input. Your code will receive three lines of input. You can accept it into your code with the following template:

```python
for i in range(3):
    data = raw_input()

The answer is:
```python
for i in range(3):
    data = raw_input()
    print("".join(reversed(data)))
```
